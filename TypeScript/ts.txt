TypeScript:
 - it is super set of javascript
 -it is compile language
 - it is strict typed language

 *how to know ts is available are not

 *how to install ts
 npm i-g typeScript //to install TypeScript
 tsc -v //check typescript version

 *how to execute typeScript file
 tsc filename.ts //compile ts file and create on plain js file

 Task :Write one parameterized function is ts which will take two parameter and display your fullname


 task: WAP parameterized function which will return area of circle passing radius values as parameter


OOPs:

1-class:
    - it is collection of data member-function
    - it is template which we can re-use
    - to create class we use class keyword

-this:it refers to the current object to access its data inside it only.

2. object: 
    - it is an instance of class
    - it allows us to access class data-member and member-function outside  class

    syntax: let objectName=new ClassName();

-Constructor :
    - it is special mamber function of class
    - it will execute automatically when class object get created or inialize
    - in ts Constructorname     must only Constructor

3.Inheritance:
    -accessing parent class property into child class
    - to perform inheritance in between classes we use extends keyword


*super():
    - it represent parent class constructor inside child class constructor
    - super method must be first statement in child class constructor
    

4.encapsulation
    -wrapping of data into single unit

-public : we can access class property inside,outside class as well as in derived(child) class
-protected:we can access class property inside same class as well as in derived(child) class
-private: we can access class property inside same class only.

5.abstraction :
    -hidding implementation and showing necessary information
    - we can achieve this by using interface,abstract class

6.polymorphism:
    - it is ability to take morethan one form
    - method overloading :when we have multiple method with same name in same class
    - method overroding : when we have multiple method with same name in different class



*module:
    - writing ys code in single or multiple file and access it in another file
    - to achieve this we use export and import keyword
    - to send data we use export
    - to access it we use import



*interface:
    - it is signature of class
    - it contain abstract method
    - to create interface we use interface keyword
    - its child class has responsibility to implement it
    - to use interface we use implement keyword
